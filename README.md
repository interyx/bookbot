# BookBot

BookBot is a small command-line tool used to do some simple analysis on a text file (like a book). It supports .txt files.

## Usage

`python3 bookbot /path/to/filename` where `/path/to/filename` is a path to a valid .txt file. The output will be a list of how frequent characters are in the text, along with a word count.
